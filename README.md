# OPâ€‘XY Vibe Coding

A real-time music creation system for the OPâ€‘XY that enables collaborative composition with AI agents through a JSON-based loop format.

## Overview

This project allows you to co-create music with AI agents that edit a canonical loop JSON file (`opxyloopâ€‘1.0`) while a Python engine plays it back in real-time to the OPâ€‘XY device. The system prioritizes glitch-free playback, bulletproof note lifecycle management, and observable behavior with tight timing constraints.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OPâ€‘XY device connected via USB-C
- macOS (primary development platform)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/op-xy-vibing.git
cd op-xy-vibing
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the System

#### Basic Playback
Play a loop with internal clock:
```bash
make play-internal LOOP=loop.json BPM=120 PORT="OP-XY"
```

Play with external clock (OPâ€‘XY as master):
```bash
make play-external LOOP=loop.json PORT="OP-XY"
```

#### Full Conductor Server (with WebSocket API)
Start the conductor server with web interface:
```bash
make conductor-run LOOP=loop.json PORT="OP-XY" BPM=120 CLOCK=external
```

Then serve the UI:
```bash
make ui-serve
```

Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

### Testing the Installation

Run clock timing tests:
```bash
make clock-smoke
```

Test note lifecycle:
```bash
make demo-note
```

Run the full test suite:
```bash
make test
```

Validate loop fixtures:
```bash
make validate-fixtures
```

## Key Features

- **Real-time MIDI playback** with external or internal clock sync
- **JSON-based loop format** optimized for AI agent collaboration
- **WebSocket API** for live editing and state monitoring
- **Atomic file operations** with Git version control
- **Robust note lifecycle** management with panic recovery
- **CC and LFO automation** with phase-locked modulation
- **Web-based UI** for visual loop editing

## Loop Format

Loops are defined using the `opxyloopâ€‘1.0` JSON specification. See `docs/opxyloop-1.0.md` for the complete format documentation.

Example minimal loop:
```json
{
  "version": "opxyloop-1.0",
  "meta": {
    "tempo": 120,
    "ppq": 96,
    "stepsPerBar": 16
  },
  "tracks": [
    {
      "type": "drum",
      "channel": 10,
      "steps": [
        {"vel": 110}, null, null, null,
        {"vel": 90}, null, null, null,
        {"vel": 110}, null, null, null,
        {"vel": 90}, null, null, null
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Available Commands

## Troubleshooting

### MIDI Connection Issues
- Ensure OPâ€‘XY is connected via USB-C
- Check MIDI port name: `python -c "import mido; print(mido.get_output_names())"`
- Use correct port name in `PORT` parameter

### Timing Problems
- Run `make clock-smoke` to check timing accuracy
- External clock issues: verify OPâ€‘XY is sending MIDI clock
- High jitter: close other applications, check CPU load

### WebSocket Errors
- Kill existing processes: `make kill-procs`
- Check port 8765 availability: `make kill-ws-port`
- Restart conductor: `make conductor-run`

### Note Hanging
- Send MIDI panic: `make panic PORT="OP-XY"`
- Check active notes are properly tracked in logs
- Verify All Notes Off on transport stop
