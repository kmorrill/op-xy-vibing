# Sample Loops Collection

This directory contains curated example loops demonstrating different musical styles and AI collaboration techniques. Each loop includes metadata with creation prompts to inspire your own musical experiments.

## How to Use These Samples

1. **Load a sample loop:**
   ```bash
   # Copy any sample to your working loop
   cp samples/house/house-chorus-8bar.json loop.json
   
   # Start the server
   source venv/bin/activate
   python3 -m conductor.conductor_server --loop loop.json --port "OP-XY"
   ```

2. **Experiment with the AI prompts:**
   - Try the original creation prompts in the metadata files
   - Use them as starting points for your own variations
   - Ask AI assistants to modify elements you want to change

3. **Learn from the patterns:**
   - Study how different genres use velocity, timing, and note patterns
   - Observe how tracks layer together (drums, bass, melody, chords)
   - Notice the use of microshift timing for groove and humanization
