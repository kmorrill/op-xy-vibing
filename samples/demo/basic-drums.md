# Basic Drums - Educational Starting Point

**File:** `basic-drums.json`  
**BPM:** 125  
**Style:** Educational/Basic  
**Length:** 1 bar  

## Description

A simple, foundational drum pattern perfect for learning the basics of the OP‑XY loop system. Features a straightforward four-on-the-floor kick with basic hi-hat and snare patterns. Ideal for beginners or as a starting point for more complex arrangements.

## Tracks Breakdown

- **Drums Only**: Single drum track with kick, snare, clap, hi-hats, and crash elements
- **Simple Pattern**: Basic 4/4 rhythm that's easy to understand and modify

## Educational Purpose

This loop demonstrates:
- How drum patterns are structured in the opxyloop-1.0 format
- Basic velocity programming (accent vs. normal hits)
- Simple 4/4 time signature patterns
- Foundation for building more complex arrangements

## AI Creation Prompts

### Getting Started
```
"Create a simple drum pattern at 125 BPM for learning. I want:
- A basic four-on-the-floor kick drum
- Simple hi-hat pattern on the off-beats
- A snare on beats 2 and 4
- Keep it very simple and easy to understand
- This should be a foundation that beginners can build on"
```

### Learning Variations
```
"Make the kick drum more prominent by increasing the velocity"
"Add some subtle hi-hat variations to make it more interesting"
"Can you add a crash cymbal on beat 1 for emphasis?"
"Make the snare hit harder on beat 4"
"Add some ghost notes on the snare for more groove"
```

## Try These Learning Exercises

### Beginner Modifications
```
"Double the hi-hat pattern - add hits on every 8th note"
"Remove the hi-hats entirely and focus on just kick and snare"
"Add a simple open hi-hat on the fourth beat of each bar"
"Make every kick drum hit the same velocity for consistency"
"Add a rim shot pattern on the off-beats"
```

### Intermediate Development  
```
"Add some subtle swing timing to make it less mechanical"
"Create a two-bar pattern instead of repeating every bar"
"Add some tom fills at the end of every 4 bars"
"Layer in a shaker pattern for additional texture"
"Add velocity variations to make it more human"
```

### Building Complexity
```
"This is too simple - add more rhythmic complexity"
"Create a house music version with more swing"
"Make it a rock pattern with different snare placement"
"Add polyrhythmic elements while keeping it learnable"
"Turn this into a full drum break with fills"
```

## Learning Concepts

- **Basic 4/4 rhythm**: Foundation of most Western popular music
- **Kick and snare relationship**: How these anchor a drum pattern
- **Hi-hat patterns**: Creating rhythmic drive and momentum
- **Velocity programming**: How to create accents and dynamics
- **Pattern structure**: Understanding how loops repeat and develop

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with this pattern:

1. **Load `drums-with-bass.json`** to see how bass integrates
2. **Experiment with tempo changes** (try 100 BPM or 140 BPM)  
3. **Add your own elements** using the AI prompts above
4. **Study house and techno samples** to see more complex patterns
5. **Create variations** by modifying velocities and timing

## Technical Learning

- **JSON structure**: See how drum events are programmed
- **MIDI channels**: Understanding how tracks are routed
- **Step sequencing**: How the 16-step grid works
- **Velocity ranges**: Normal (70-100), accent (105+), ghost (30-55)
- **Length parameters**: How note durations work

Perfect for first-time users learning both the OP‑XY system and basic drum programming concepts.
